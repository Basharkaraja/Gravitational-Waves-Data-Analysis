This project first investigates gravitational wave (GW) data from two significant events, GW190814
and GW170817, recorded by the LIGO detectors at Livingston and Hanford. Fourier analysis revealed multiple noise peaks affecting the signal, and dominating noise at low-frequency. Very
short-lived rapid decaying structures are observed in the data due to the increasingly high frequency of the generated gravitational waves as the two body components draw nearer to each
other before merging. Signal contributions were concentrated between 50 Hz to 250 Hz across
all mergers. Spectrograms pre-filtering or the usage of the Q-transform method showed a chirping peak clearly in GW190814-L1 but almost no visibility to that of GW190814-H1 with both
having noise affecting the clarity. Post-filtering and applying Q-transform have been done to the data to get rid of the noise. For 
GW170817-L1, Q-transform yielded a noisy behavior with no discernible chirping peaks, while
GW170817-H1 lost the almost invisible chirping peak entirely. This suggests that Q-transform
techniques are effective for massive objects like black holes but less so for lighter objects like neutron stars. The latter has also shown longer merging duration and less sharp peaks than a black
hole merger. Matched filtering, however, proved efficient in extracting buried signals from both
quiet and noisy GW events, even when signals were faint
